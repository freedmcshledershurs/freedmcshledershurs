If you only need to borrow a couple hundred dollars, asking one of your closest friends or a family member to lend you the money can be a great option. Although you may feel self-conscious or even embarrassed about asking for such a favor, borrowing money from someone you know will give you the flexibility to pay them back at your pace, without having to worry about dents in your credit report.
