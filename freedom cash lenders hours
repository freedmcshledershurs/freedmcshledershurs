Personal loans have one of the lowest interest rates available among credit products. Currently, the average personal loan interest rate is 10.99 percent compared to 20.44 percent, which is the average interest rate for credit cards. One of the benefits of using a personal loan to finance an emergency is that they have fixed interest rates and terms, so your payments will remain the same over the life of the loan. Besides that, many companies give borrowers between two and seven years to pay off their loans, making monthly payments more manageable.
